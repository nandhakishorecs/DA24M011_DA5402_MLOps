To execute the assignment, open the directory with all the files in a terminal window. 

1. Initiate a virtual environment and activate the environment: \
   **$ python3 -m venv env\_name** \
   **$ source env\_name/bin/activate**
2. Install the required python packages using pip. \
**$ pip install -r requirements.txt**
3. Create a connected terminal and run the server in the background. \
**$ python3 server.py**
4. n the adjacent terminal, run the application \
**$ python3 app.py** \
The canvas appears to get the input and when the prediction is done in the UI, it invokes the API to do prediction in the server file.
